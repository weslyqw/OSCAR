# Oscar assessment
This is a test to assess your coding skills.

## Technical requirements
The application **needs** to be build with API-first mentality.
It also **needs** to follow the coding standards associated with PSR-12.
The application **needs** to use SQL database.
You **can** use PSR-4 autoloading system.
You **can** put comments where you describe why you do certain things or just explaining some more high level decision.

## Technical restrictions
The application **must not** be build using external libraries or frameworks.
You are **allowed to** use any library for testing the application.

## The task
1. The code **has to** read files that are in different formats (csv, json) and contain various cars related data.
These files will have different structure, so take your time to study them.

2. You **must** create a service that validates and combines the data in a unified structure.

3. The code **must** save the information in the database, without losing any data.
Make sure to build the schema scalable for any potential changes to the structure in the future.

3. The code **must** implement a series of endpoints to retrieve the information saved in the database.

4. The code **should** implement an endpoint for creating cars.

5. The code **should** be covered with unit tests.

6. The code **should** be built using TDD approach.

7. The code **can** be built on top of Docker.

8. The provided code **must** have deployment instructions.

## Notes
Legend:
- **must not**, **has to**, **must**, **needs** = this is mandatory
- **should**, **should not**, **allowed to** = this is recommended
- **can** = this is up to you

Feel free to create your own folder structure.
If something is not clear, make an assumption.
In doubt of technical issues you can send a mail with your questions.
